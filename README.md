# MongoDB CRUD Project
## Objective:
This checkpoint aims to practice MongoDB CRUD operations by manipulating a database called "contact" and a collection called "contactlist".

## Getting Started
To get started with the MongoDB CRUD operations checkpoint, you'll need to have MongoDB installed on your system. 
If you haven't installed MongoDB yet, you can download and install it from the official MongoDB website: MongoDB Download Center.

To integrate MongoDB CRUD operations with Node.js and Express, you'll need to install the required packages and set up your project. 
Here's a step-by-step guide:
1. Initialize your Node.js project
   If you haven't already, create a new directory for your project and initialize a new Node.js project using npm.
   Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following commands:

bash
Copy code
mkdir mongodb-express-crud
cd mongodb-express-crud
npm init -y
